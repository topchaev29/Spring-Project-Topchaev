        <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This can include tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI systems can be designed to learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and perform tasks with varying levels of autonomy. The goal of AI is to create machines that can simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that are typically associated with human cognition.</p>
